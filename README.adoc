= Connect the Tables: How to Graph Relational Databases

This is the repository containing resources accompanying the Graphing Relational Databases project with Neo4j (graph database) and MariaDB (relational database).

== Project background

In this project, we will see how to translate part or all data from a relational format into a graph. Goals of this project include the following:

1. Learn the basics of migrating the model and practical steps for actually implementing it.
2. Understand naming and case conventions when migrating from tables to graphs, as well as some principles for a successful graph model.
3. Get concrete steps for graphing relational databases.

== Presentation

PDF versions of accompanying presentations are published to SpeakerDeck.
